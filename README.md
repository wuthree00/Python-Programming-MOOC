# Python Programming MOOC notes
This repository contains my notes and solutions to the **University of Helsinki’s “Python Programming MOOC 2025”**.  

Exercises are organised into folders according to the course structure (Part 1 to Part 7).

All filenames follow the original exercise numbering on the MOOC website  
(eg. `2.3-gift-tax-calculator.py` corresponds to Part 2 → Section 3 → “Gift tax calculator” exercise).
