# Python Programming MOOC notes
This repository contains my notes and solutions to the **[University of Helsinki Python Programming MOOC 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/)**.


Exercises are organised into folders according to the course structure (Part 1 to Part 3).
This repository is updated continuously as I progress through the course.

All filenames follow the original exercise numbering on the MOOC website  
(eg. `2.3-gift-tax-calculator.py` corresponds to Part 2 → Section 3 → “Gift tax calculator” exercise).
