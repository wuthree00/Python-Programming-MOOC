## Please write a function named block_correct(sudoku: list, row_no: int, column_no: int),
## which takes a two-dimensional array representing a sudoku grid,
## and two integers referring to the row and column indexes of a single square, as its arguments.
## Rows and columns are indexed from 0.

# The function should return True or False depending on whether the 3 by 3 block to the right and down from the given indexes is filled in correctly.
# That is, whether the block contains each of the numbers 1 to 9 at most once.

# Notice that this function does not strictly follow the rules of sudoku.
# In a real game of sudoku there are only 9 blocks to check,
# and these are located at indexes (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 6), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 6), (6, 0), (6, 3) and (6, 6).
# Such restrictions on indexes should not be implemented here.

# Sample output:                     #
# False                              #
# True                               #
#------------------------------------#

# The first function call should check the 3 by 3 block beginning with the square at indexes 0, 0:
# 9 0 0
# 2 0 0
# 0 2 0

# The second function call should check the 3 by 3 block beginning with the square at row 1, column 2:
# 0 2 5
# 0 3 0
# 4 0 0
# The second block would not be checked in an actual game of sudoku,
# but your function should allow for it to be checked.


## Solution:
def block_correct(sudoku: list, row_no: int, column_no: int):
    list_of_block_values = []
    #collect all the values in the 3x3 block into a list
    for i in range(row_no, row_no+3):
        for j in range(column_no, column_no+3):
            list_of_block_values.append(sudoku[i][j])
    #for numbers 1-9, check if any appear more than once in the 3x3 block
    for number in range(1,10):
        if list_of_block_values.count(number) > 1:
            return False
    return True
