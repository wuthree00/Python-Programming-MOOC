## In this exercise we are handling tuples just like the ones described in the previous exercise.

## Please write a function named older_people(people: list, year: int),
## which selects all those people on the list who were born before the year given as an argument.
## The function should return the names of these people in a new list.

# An example of its use:
#------------------------------------#
# p1 = ("Adam", 1977)                #
# p2 = ("Ellen", 1985)               #
# p3 = ("Mary", 1953)                #
# p4 = ("Ernest", 1997)              #
# people = [p1, p2, p3, p4]          #
#                                    #
# older = older_people(people, 1979) #
# print(older)                       #
#------------------------------------#

# Sample output:
# [ 'Adam', 'Mary' ]


## Solution:
def older_people(people: list, year: int):
    new_list = []
    for person in people:
        if person[-1] < year:
            new_list.append(person[0])
    return new_list

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p1 = ("Adam", 1977)
    p2 = ("Ellen", 1985)
    p3 = ("Mary", 1953)
    p4 = ("Ernest", 1997)
    people = [p1, p2, p3, p4]

    older = older_people(people, 1979)
    print(older)



# The model solution provided:
# def older_people(people: list, year: int):
#     lst = []
#     for person in people:
#         if person[1] < year:
#             lst.append(person[0])
#     return lst
