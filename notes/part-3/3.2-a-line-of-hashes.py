## Please write a program which prints out a line of hash characters, the width of which is chosen by the user.
# Note that the single apostrophes are not printed out by the programme but are used to distinguish the # marking the comments and the printed output.

## Sample output
Width: 3
# '###'


## Sample output
# Width: 8
# '########'

print(width*"#")
