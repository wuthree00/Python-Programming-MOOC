## Please write a program which asks the user to input a string.
## The program then prints out different messages if the string contains any of the vowels a, e or o.

# You may assume the input will be in lowercase entirely. Have a look at the examples below.

## Sample output
# Please type in a string: hello there
# a not found
# e found
# o found

## Sample output
# Please type in a string: hiya
# a found
# e not found
# o not found


## Solution
string = input("Please type in a string:")

if "a" in string:
    print("a found")
else:
    print("a not found")
if "e" in string:
    print("e found")
else:
    print("e not found")
if "o" in string:
    print("o found")
else:
    print("o not found")
