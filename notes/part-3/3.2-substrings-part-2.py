## Please write a program which asks the user to type in a string.
## The program then prints out all the substrings which end with the last character, from the shortest to the longest.
# Have a look at the example below.

## Sample output
# Please type in a string: test
# t
# st
# est
# test


## Solution
word = input("Please type in a string:")
a = -1

while a*-1 <= len(word):
    print(word[a:])
    a -= 1
