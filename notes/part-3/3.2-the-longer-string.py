## Please write a program which asks the user for two strings and then prints out whichever is the longer of the two - that is, whichever has the more characters.
## If the strings are of equal length, the program should print out "The strings are equally long".

# Some examples of expected behaviour:

## Sample output
# Please type in string 1: hey
# Please type in string 2: hiya
# hiya is longer

## Sample output
# Please type in string 1: howdy doody
# Please type in string 2: hola
# howdy doody is longer

## Sample output
# Please type in string 1: hey
# Please type in string 2: bye
# The strings are equally long


## Solution
string1 = input("Please type in string 1:")
string2 = input("Please type in string 2:")

if len(string1) > len(string2):
    print(f"{string1} is longer")
elif len(string2) > len(string1):
    print(f"{string2} is longer")

else:
    print("The strings are equally long")
