## Please write a program which prints out all the even numbers between two and thirty, using a loop.
## Print each number on a separate line.

# The beginning of your output should look like this:

## Sample output
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# etc...


## Solution:

while number <= 30:
    print(number)
    number += 2
