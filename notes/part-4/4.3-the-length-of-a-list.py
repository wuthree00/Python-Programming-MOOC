## Please write a function named length which takes a list as its argument and returns the length of the list.

## example of the programme:
#--------------------------------
# my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# result = length(my_list)
# print("The length is", result)

# the list given as an argument doesn't need to be stored in any variable
# result = length([1, 1, 1, 1])
# print("The length is", result)
#--------------------------------

## Sample output
# The length is 5
# The length is 4


## Solution:
# Write your solution here
def length(my_list):
    return len(my_list)

# Test your function by calling it within the following block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = length(my_list)
    print("The length is", result)
