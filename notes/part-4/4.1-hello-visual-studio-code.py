### Note that exercises from part 4 onwards are done in visual studio code! ###

## Please write a program which asks the user which editor they are using.
## The program should keep on asking until the user types in Visual Studio Code.

# Have a look at the example of expected behaviour below:

## Sample output
# Editor: Emacs
# not good
# Editor: Vim
# not good
# Editor: Word
# awful
# Editor: Atom
# not good
# Editor: Visual Studio Code
# an excellent choice!

# If the user types in Word or Notepad, the program counters with awful.
# Other unacceptable editor choices receive the reply not good.

# The program should be case-insensitive in its reactions.
# That is, the same user input in lowercase, uppercase or mixed case should trigger the same reaction:

## Sample output
# Editor: NOTEPAD
# awful
# Editor: viSUal STudiO cODe
# an excellent choice!


## Solution:
while True:
    editor = input("editor: ")
    if editor.lower() == "visual studio code":
        break
    if editor == "word" or editor == "notepad":
        print("awful")
    else:
        print("not good")
print("an excellent choice!")


# Hint: The simplest way to achieve this is converting all characters to the same case.
# The Python string method lower converts a string to lowercase entirely.
# An example of its use:

#----------------------------------------------------
# mystring = "Visual Studio CODE"
# if "visual studio code" == mystring.lower():
#    print("this was the string I was looking for!")
#----------------------------------------------------

# NB: this exercise doesn't ask you to write any functions, so you should not place any code within an if __name__ == "__main__" block.
# The same applies to any upcoming exercises that don't explicitly ask for functions.
