## Please write three functions: first_word, second_word and last_word.
## Each function takes a string argument.

## As their names imply, the functions return either the first, the second or the last word in the sentence they receive as their string argument.

## In each case you may assume the argument string contains at least two separate words, and all words are separated by exactly one space character.
## There will be no spaces in the beginning or at the end of the argument strings.

#---------------------------------------------
# sentence = "it was a dark and stormy python"
# print(first_word(sentence)) # it
# print(second_word(sentence)) # was
# print(last_word(sentence)) # python

## Sample output
# it
# was
# python

# sentence = "it was"
# print(second_word(sentence)) # was
# print(last_word(sentence)) # was
#---------------------------------------------


## Solution:
def first_word(sentence):
    words = sentence.split(" ")
    return words[0]

def second_word(sentence):
    words = sentence.split(" ")
    return words[1]

def last_word(sentence):
    words = sentence.split(" ")
    return words[-1]

# Test the function by calling it within the following block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sentence = "it was"
    print(first_word(sentence))
    print(second_word(sentence))
    print(last_word(sentence))
