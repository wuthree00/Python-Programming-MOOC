## Please write a program which keeps asking the user for a PIN code until they type in the correct one, which is 4321.
## The program should then print out the number of times the user tried different codes.

## Sample output
# PIN: 3245
# Wrong
# PIN: 1234
# Wrong
# PIN: 0000
# Wrong
# PIN: 4321
# Correct! It took you 4 attempts

# If the user gets it right on the first try, the program should print out something a bit different:

## Sample output
# PIN: 4321
# Correct! It only took you one single attempt!


## Solution:
attempts = 0

while True:
    pin = input(("PIN:"))
    attempts += 1

    if pin == "4321":
        success = True
        break
        
    if pin != "4321":
        success = False
        print("Wrong")

if success:
    if attempts == 1:
        print("Correct! It only took you one single attempt!")
    else:
        print(f"Correct! It took you {int(attempts)} attempts")
