## Please write a program which asks the user for three letters.
## The program should then print out whichever of the three letters would be in the middle if the letters were in alphabetical order.

## You may assume the letters will be either all uppercase, or all lowercase.

## Some examples of expected behaviour:

## Sample output
# 1st letter: x
# 2nd letter: c
# 3rd letter: p
# The letter in the middle is p

## Sample output
# 1st letter: C
# 2nd letter: B
# 3rd letter: A
# The letter in the middle is B


## Solution:
letter1 = input("1st letter:")
letter2 = input("2nd letter:")
letter3 = input("3rd letter:")

if letter2 < letter1 < letter3 or letter3 < letter1 < letter2:
    print(f"The letter in the middle is {letter1}")
elif letter1 < letter2 < letter3 or letter3 < letter2 < letter1:
    print(f"The letter in the middle is {letter2}")
elif letter1 < letter3 < letter2 or letter2 < letter3 < letter1:
    print(f"The letter in the middle is {letter3}")
