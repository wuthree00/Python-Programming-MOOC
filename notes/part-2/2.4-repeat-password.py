## Please write a program which asks the user for a password.
## The program should then ask the user to type in the password again.
## If the user types in something else than the first password, the program should keep on asking until the user types the first password again correctly.

# Have a look at the expected behaviour below:

## Sample output
# Password: sekred
# Repeat password: secret
# They do not match!
# Repeat password: cantremember
# They do not match!
# Repeat password: sekred
# User account created!


## Solution:
password = input("Password:")

while True:
    password_repeat = input("Repeat password:")
    if password_repeat == password:
        print("User account created!")
        break
    else:
        print("They do not match!")
